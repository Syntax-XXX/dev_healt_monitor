# Developer Health Monitor

## Why I Created This Project

As a developer, I found myself spending countless hours coding in my free time. While working on personal projects and learning new technologies was exciting, I often lost track of time—sometimes coding late into the night or even until morning. This led to many sleepless nights, fatigue, and a noticeable impact on my health and well-being.

I realized that, like many developers, I needed a tool to help me become more aware of my coding habits and encourage healthier work patterns. There are plenty of productivity tools, but very few that focus on the health of the developer behind the code.

## What This Project Does

**Developer Health Monitor** is a tool designed to:
- Track your coding sessions and alert you if you’re working too long without breaks.
- Warn you about late-night coding and excessive daily/weekly hours.
- Remind you to hydrate, stretch, and check your posture.
- Encourage you to reflect on your mood and stress levels.
- Provide positive reinforcement for healthy habits.

All analysis is done locally, and your data never leaves your machine. The goal is to help developers like myself maintain a healthier balance between passion for coding and personal well-being.

## Privacy
All data and analysis are performed locally on your machine. No information is sent anywhere or shared by default.
